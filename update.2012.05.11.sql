If you take issue with a decision, you must do so privately with the staff member who issued the decision or with an administrator of the site. Complaining about staff decisions in public or otherwise disrespecting staff members will not be taken lightly.\r\n[*]Access to this website is a privilege, not a right, and it can be taken away from you for any reason.\r\n[*]One account per person per lifetime. Anyone creating additional accounts will be banned.\r\n[*]Avatars must not exceed 512kB or be vertically longer than 400px. Avatars must be safe for work, be entirely unoffensive and not contain any nudity or religious imagery. Use common sense.\r\n[*]Do not post our .torrent files on other sites. Every .torrent file has your personal passkey embedded in it. The tracker will automatically disable your account if you share your torrent files with others. You will not get your account back. This doesn''t prohibit you sharing the content on other sites, just the .torrent file.\r\n[*]Any torrent you are seeding to this tracker must only have our tracker''s URL in it. Adding another tracker''s URL will cause incorrect data to be sent to our tracker, and will lead to you getting disabled for cheating. \r\n[*]This is a torrent site which promotes sharing amongst the community. If you are not willing to give back to the community what you take from it, this site is not for you. In other words, we expect you to have an acceptable share ratio. If you download a torrent, please, seed the copy you have until there are sufficient people seeding as well before you stop.\r\n[*]Do not browse the site using proxies or TOR. The site will automatically alert us.  This includes VPNs with dynamic IP addresses.\r\n[*]Asking for invites to any site is not allowed anywhere on What.CD or our IRC network. Invites may be offered in the Invites forum, and nowhere else.\r\n[*]Trading and selling invites is strictly prohibited, as is offering them in public - this includes on any forum which is not a class-restricted section on an invitation-only torrent site.\r\n[*]Trading, selling, sharing, or giving away your account is prohibited as well. PM a mod to disable you if you no longer want it.\r\n[*]You''re completely responsible for the people you invite. If your invitees are caught cheating or trading/selling invites, not only will they be banned, so will you. Be careful who you invite. Invites are a precious commodity.\r\n[*]Be careful when sharing an IP or a computer with a friend if they have (or have had) an account. From then on your accounts will be inherently linked and if one of you violates the rules, both accounts will be disabled along with any other accounts linked by IP. This rule applies to logging into the site.\r\n[*]Attempting to find or exploit a bug in the site code is the worst possible offense you can commit. We have automatic systems in place for monitoring these activities, and committing them will result in the banning of you, your inviter, and your inviter''s entire invite tree. \r\n[*]We''re a community. Working together is what makes this place what it is. There are well over a thousand new torrents uploaded every day and sadly the staff aren''t psychic. If you come across something which violates a rule, report it! Ignoring it is only damaging the community.\r\n[*]We respect the wishes of other sites here, as we wish for them to do the same. Please refrain from posting links or full names of sites that want not to be mentioned.\r\n[clientlist]', '2012-05-11 21:19:19'),

This is called "ratio watch". \r\n\r\nThe required ratio is <strong>NOT the extra amount of ratio you need to gain</strong>. It is the <strong>minimum</strong> required ratio you must maintain. \r\n\r\nYour required ratio is unique, and is calculated from the amount you''ve downloaded, and the percentage of your snatched torrents which you are still seeding. \r\n\r\n[b]It is not necessary to know how this ratio is calculated. What you need to know is that downloading makes the required ratio go up (bad) and seeding your snatches forever makes your required ratio go down (good). You can view your required ratio in the site header (it is the "Required" value). You want a high ratio, and a low required ratio.[/b]\r\n\r\nThe exact formula for calculating the required ratio is provided merely for the curious. It is done in three steps. \r\n\r\nThe first step is by determining how high and how low your required ratio can be.

Your request will be deleted and you will not get your bounty back. Requests cannot be more specific than the upload (and trumping) rules. For example, requesting an MP3 torrent with a log when the rules prohibit replacing an MP3 torrent without a log. Such a request asks for a duplicate to be uploaded. Exceptions: Requests made before the November 2008 rule change are not subject to deletion. However, you are advised to edit such older requests to comply with the rules.\r\n[*][b]Only one title (application, album, ...) per request.[/b] No requests for multiple albums (discographies) or vague requirements. You may ask for multiple formats, but you cannot specify all of them. For example, you may ask for either a FLAC or V0, but not both formats. You may also make a list of albums by one artist that satisfies your request, but the request can be filled with only one album. Application requests can consist of only one application, but may span a range of different versions. However, such requests can be filled with only one version of that title.\r\n[*][b]Do not unfill requests for trivial reasons.[/b] If you did not specify in your request what you wanted (such as bitrates or a particular edition), do not unfill and later change the description. Do not unfill requests if you are unsure of what you are doing (e.g. the filled torrent may be a transcode, but you don''t know how to tell). Ask for help from <a href="/staff.php">staff</a> in that case. You may unfill if the torrent doesn''t fit your specifications stated clearly in the request.\r\n[*][b]All users must have an equal chance to fill a request.[/b] Trading upload credit is not allowed. Abusing the request system to exchange favors for other users is not tolerated. That includes making specific requests for certain users (whether explicitly named or not). Making requests for releases, and then unfilling so that one particular user can fill the request is not allowed. If reported, both the requester and user filling the request will receive a warning and lose the request bounty.\r\n[*][b]No manipulation of the requester for bounty.[/b] The bounty is a reward for helping other users&mdash;it should not be a ransom.
